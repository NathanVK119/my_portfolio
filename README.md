# My Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website that showcases my **skills**, **projects**, and my **story** — from being a web developer to transitioning into a QA Automation career.

## 📌 About This Project

As a fresh graduate, I created this portfolio to present myself professionally in the tech industry. Even while I was still a student, I already started freelancing as a web developer. Over time, I discovered my strong attention to detail and passion for quality — which led me to explore **QA Manual Testing** and eventually **QA Automation**.

This website reflects not just my technical skills but also my journey, mindset, and the continuous growth I'm aiming for in the field of Quality Assurance and Software Testing.

## 💡 Fun Fact

Even before diving into QA Automation, I was already very meticulous with bug checking as a developer. My perfectionist eyes for visual issues, responsiveness, and functionality made me realize that I naturally fit into the QA world — and now, I'm building automation skills using Cypress while combining my dev background and passion for clean systems.
